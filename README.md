## Full-Stack Software Development student with Code Institute


### About me
Hi, my name's Kate and I recently completed a **Level 5(EQF) Diploma in Full-Stack Software Development** with the **Code Institute**. I'm committed to a career move into Software Development and consider some of my key strengths to be:
<br>
:arrows_counterclockwise: UX Design
<br>
:art: UI Design
<br>
:page_facing_up: Documentation
<br>
:speech_balloon: Communication
<br>
:busts_in_silhouette: Teamwork
<br>
<br>
Check out my [Portfolio Projects](#portfolio-projects) completed as part of my Code Institute course below :point_down:
<br>
<br>
I've always been drawn to coding and I think this is because of my propensity for method and order. I love that writing code allows me to be organised and methodical but also enables my creativity (something I would not have considered myself capable of in the past!).

Some of my other interests include:
<br>
:knife: Cooking
<br>
:video_game: Gaming
<br>
:blue_book: Reading
<br>
:racing_car: Motorsport
<br>
<br>
I'm particularly interested in working on projects around :recycle: renewable energy and climate change :earth_africa:
