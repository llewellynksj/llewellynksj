## Full-Stack Software Development student with Code Institute


### About me
Hi, my name's Kate and I'm currently pursuing a career change into the world of Tech. I'm undertaking a **Level 5(EQF) Diploma in Full-Stack Software Development** with the **Code Institute**.
<br>
I've always been drawn to coding and I think this is because of my propensity for method and order. I love that writing code allows me to be organised and methodical but also enables my creativity (something I would not have considered myself capable of in the past!).

Some of my other interests include:
<br>
:knife: Cooking
<br>
:video_game: Gaming
<br>
:blue_book: Reading
<br>
:racing_car: Motorsport

<br>
My pronouns are she/her/hers
